# Statement Unfolding

Statement Unfolding is a project that seeks to reveal the deeper meanings, definitions, and biases in a conversation by decomposing each key term into its constituent parts. It illustrates how two individuals can use identical terms but operate on vastly different levels of abstraction.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is twofold:

1. To demonstrate how terms and phrases in a conversation can be unpacked to expose their underlying definitions and assumptions. In particular, this project highlights how the same term can carry different meanings for different people due to their varying levels of historical knowledge, life experiences, and depth of reflection on the subject.

2. To examine how different levels of abstraction and alignment in functional properties of terms can affect the ability of two individuals to engage in meaningful conversation. This is achieved by showing how biases, which individuals may be unaware of, can influence their understanding and usage of terms, thus affecting the coherence of their conversation.

## Approach

The approach adopted in this project is inspired by the principles of computational dialectics, an area of AI that focuses on the language and protocols used by agents to construct judgment or agreement in a fair and effective way.

The project uses a three-step process to break down a conversation:

1. **Parsing the Conversation:** The conversation is parsed into individual statements. Each statement is then further broken down into its constituent terms.

2. **Assigning Definitions:** Definitions are assigned to each term, revealing the implicit assumptions and biases of the speaker. These definitions are layered to reflect different levels of abstraction.

3. **Visualization:** The parsed and defined conversation is presented in a tree-like structure. This visualization allows users to explore the conversation interactively and delve into the deeper meanings and biases associated with each term.

In conclusion, the Statement Unfolding project aims to expose the underlying biases and assumptions in a conversation and highlight the challenges of meaningful communication when the same terms carry different meanings for different individuals.

# Create React App

This directory is a brief example of a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) site that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Create React App project with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/create-react-app&template=create-react-app)

_Live Example: https://create-react-template.vercel.app/_

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
